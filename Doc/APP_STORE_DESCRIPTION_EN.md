## App Name
Moments+

## Subtitle
Your moments, remembered

## Promotional Text
Your photos, remembered as moments. Explore where and when on a map.

## Description
Photos pile up. Moments+ helps you see them differently — not as files, but as the moments they captured.

• **Groups by time and place** - Photos from the same trip, the same afternoon, the same coffee shop — they belong together.

• **A map of your memories** - See where you've been. Tap a city, zoom into a neighborhood, rediscover places you'd forgotten.

• **Add your own notes** - Sometimes a photo needs context. Jot down what you were thinking, who you were with.

• **Stays on your phone** - No cloud uploads. Your photos remain yours.
